# SpinningMaze_version2
My own continuation of Tech@NYU game jam project "SpinningMaze" that was originally created with joshRamirez.
Link to original project: https://github.com/joshRamirez/SpinningMaze/

In this project, the player controls the movement of a ball with the w,a,s,d keys and a 3D cube with the i,j,k,l keys.
The player must navigate through the maze on the cube and gather collectables in order to win.
